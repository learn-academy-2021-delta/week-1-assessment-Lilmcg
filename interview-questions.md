# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:
Git uses commands to allows multiple programmers, working on the same project, to manage their versions of code on the shared project. Github is the web user application that provides additional features and storage for the programmers repositories of code.

Researched answer:
Git is a version control system that allows you to track the changes that programmers make to code. Git is software that is installed in your local system and uses a command line tool, while Github is a hosting service using a web-based user interface. Github works side by side with Git by pulling data from Git. Github provides a vast amount of storage space and a place to access your projects and your Git working directories and repositories. Github provides extra features that allow for the copying of a repository, creation of notifications for a "pull request" and for merging code changes to the main repository. Github also allows users from all over the world to connect with each other.


2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: = == === > < >= <=

  Researched answer:
  Equality (==, ===), relational (><, >=, <=), and logical (and, or, not) operators return a Boolean value of true or false.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:
  Index is the position of a character in a string or a value in an array. Value is a number, string, boolean, null, unidentified.

  Researched answer:
  Index is the address or placeholder of each character in a string or value in an array.  Value is a number, string, boolean, null, unidentified, or symbol.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer:
  Built-in methods are coding shortcuts for functions that were repeatedly used by programmers.

  Researched answer:
  Built in methods were created for common functions that are used so frequently that they were built right into the Javascript language. The most useful built in methods include date, math, string, array and objects.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  Proper pair programming is two programmers that work together on the same coding project. It requires one of the programmers to be the driver who inputs the actual code. The other programmer is the navigator who oversees the coding input and provides the next steps. The programmers will switch roles periodically.

  Researched answer:
  Pair programming started in the 90's. It is a driver-navigator technique involving two programmers that work on the same system. The programmer writing the code is the driver. While the driver enters the code, the navigator reviews the code and communicates a plan of action. Communication is critical in pair programming. It requires constant back-and-forth communication between the programmers. The driver should communicate throughout the coding process to keep the navigator engaged and to avoid the navigator from zoning out. The programmers should switch roles periodically and the workload should be shared so that each participant gains knowledge over the course of the project. Proper pair programming helps to reduce mistakes, allows for brainstorming, and creates accountability. There are different pairing techniques that can be used depending on the task at hand. In the strong style pairing technique, if the driver has an idea they have to pass over the keyboard. In this case the navigator communicates the idea and makes all the decisions.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:

  Shortcut for quickly commenting out multiple lines of existing code or text all at once.
  Shortcut for repeating the last command in terminal.
  Learning to read the terminal error messages so I can fix my code based on the message.
  How to create a practice file of the challenges that were competed during the pair programming.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: Repeating an action for a specified number of times until a required outcome or condition is met. A loop is an example of an iteration. A loop will continue to repeat itself if the condition is true and will stop when its false.

2. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are a subset of built in methods that act on arrays. They take at least one value, or more and returns another function. Examples include .map(value, index, array) and .filter(value, index, array).

3. Jest: Jest is a testing framework to ensure quality of your code. It returns an error message that shows where the problem is in the code.

4. Objects: Objects are more complex than a datatype. They can contain primitive data types (number, string, Boolean,etc), variables and functions.

5. Classes: Classes are special functions and are reusable just like functions. They contain any kind of data and behavior. They are the template for creating objects. Dog and coffee is an example of a class.
